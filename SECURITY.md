# Security Policy

## Supported Packaging and distribution methods

Alpaca only supports [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) packaging officially, any other packaging methods might not behave as expected.
Thus, official security-related support is only provided to the Flatpak distribution as of right now.
This may be subject to change in the future.

## Official Versions

The only ways Alpaca is being distributed officially are:

- [Alpaca's GitHub Repository Releases Page](https://github.com/Jeffser/Alpaca/releases)
- [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/com.jeffser.Alpaca)

## Where to report critical security vulnerabilities

As Alpaca is a public project with several thousands of users, it's extremely vital to keep it secure.
Flatpak confines it already due to sandboxing mechanisms, but nothing is bulletproof.

If you believe to have found a critical security vulnerability, **DO NOT** disclose it publicly immediately.
Allow for it to be patched first and **use the contact methods listed in the maintainer's profile** ([Jeffser](https://github.com/Jeffser))
to disclose any vulnerability privately.

Thank you in advance!
