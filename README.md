## Installation

### Flathub

You can find the latest stable version of the app on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/com.jeffser.Alpaca)

### Flatpak Package

Everytime a new version is published they become available on the [releases page](https://github.com/Jeffser/Alpaca/releases) of the repository

### Snap Package

You can also find the Snap package on the [releases page](https://github.com/Jeffser/Alpaca/releases), to install it run this command:
```BASH
sudo snap install ./{package name} --dangerous
```
The `--dangerous` comes from the package being installed without any involvement of the SnapStore, I'm working on getting the app there, but for now you can test the app this way.

### Nix

Alpaca is also available in Nixpkgs. See [package info](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=alpaca&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=alpaca) for installation instructions.

Notes:

1. The package is not maintained by the author, but by [@Aleksanaa](https://github.com/Aleksanaa), thus any issues uncertain whether related to packaging or not, should be reported to [Nixpkgs issues](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/new/choose).
2. Alpaca is automatically updated in Nixpkgs, but with a delay, and new updates will only be available after testing.
3. Alpaca in Nixpkgs does not come with sandboxing by default, which means if you want to directly execute the scripts generated by ollama (without even reviewing them first), we do not provide any isolation to prevent you from shooting yourself in the foot. You can still leverage [Nixpak](https://github.com/nixpak/nixpak) or [Firejail](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Firejail) for a convenient sandboxing.

### Building Git Version

Note: This is not recommended since the prerelease versions of the app often present errors and general instability.

1. Clone the project
2. Open with Gnome Builder
3. Press the run button (or export if you want to build a Flatpak package)
