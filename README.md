Quick Ask is a mini mode you can use to have a quick temporary chat that isn't saved as a full chat.

Great for asking something, getting a response and moving on with your work.

```BASH
flatpak run com.jeffser.Alpaca --quick-ask
```

## Launch in Live Chat Mode

> Available since Alpaca 7.0.0

Live Chat is a great way of having a live conversation with your models as if you were in a call with them.

Great for natural conversations with models and roleplay.

```BASH
flatpak run com.jeffser.Alpaca --live-chat
```

You can add your respective command as as keyboard shortcut in your system settings to quickly access Alpaca at anytime!
